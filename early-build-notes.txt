Setup an alpine linux container
opened port 4200 - default for shell in a box
installed shellinabox
added a user or two for shell access (of course root is a non-starter for shell access)


shell history (this bit got me as far as opening a terminal session in the shell)

  "to do" items
  
  test out scp as the method to move files on and off the container
  
  install and test soscleaner
  
  work out the alias between the cleaner user's home directory and a working directory
  on /cohesity/mounts/ephemeral -- this is an internal/hidden view on the Cohesity cluster.
  A good place to process these logs in terms of size.
  
  Need to look at log format and zip / gzip issues, if any
  
  Will need to build all the athena wrapping stuff -- appspec.yaml, etc.
